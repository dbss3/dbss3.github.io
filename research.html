									<h3 class="major">Observable effects of cloud particle porosity and irregular shapes</h3>

									<p >Since the first observations of exoplanet atmospheres clouds have had a major impact on the observed 
										spectra. It is therefore essential to understand the processes that affect their formation,
										as well as the details of the cloud particles themselves and the impact it can have on atmospheric opacity. 
										The wide range of planetary parameters seen in exoplanets offers a unique laboratory to explore chemistry and 
										stellar environments that are not observable in our solar system. Furthermore, we now know that most exoplanets
										do not look like solar system planets, instead they are a size intermediate between the Earth and Neptune. 
										These so called 'Mini-Neptunes' and 'Super-Earths', are what I ultimately aim to study.</p>



									<p>Cloud particles are often modelled as compact spheres. This is expected to not be the case, instead being non-compact and irregularly shaped.</p>
									<div class="box alt">

At the interface between materials micro-porosity is expected to occur, and the non-spherical shape is modelled by a distribution of hollow spheres.</em></figcaption></div>
									</div>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>To explore the inclusion of empty space into the cloud particle, which we term 'micro-porosity' we introduce a parameter 
									   (<em>f</em><sub>por</sub>) to modify the effective density of the cloud particles, constant across the atmosphere. 
									   Optical affects are modelled by including the volume as vacuum, using Mie and effective medium theory.</p>

										<figcaption><em>Refractive indices for Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> with increasing micro-porosity fractions included using effective medium theory.</em></figcaption></span><br>
										To include details on irregularly shaped particles we use a statistical distribution of hollow spheres (DHS), a hollow sphere is made up of a vacuum core and a material mantle. Each hollow sphere in the distribution is defined by the ratio of the volume of the material mantle <em>f</em><sub>hol</sub>. This distribution is then averaged over using Mie theory for optical properties.</p>

									<figcaption><em>Illustrative figure of hollow spheres with increasing f</em><sub>hol</sub><em>. The volume of the mantle is conserved for all hollow spheres in the distribution.</em></figcaption><br>

										<figcaption><em>Pressure at which micro-porous and non-spherical clouds become optically thick for a Drift-Phoenix with T</em><sub>eff</sub> = 1800 K, log(g [cms<sup>-2</sup>]) = 3.0<em> atmosphere. 
									   If the cloud never becomes optically thick the bottom of the atmosphere is returned ( ~2 bar). JWST instrument wavelengths are shown by the coloured bars, artist impression of the deployed JWST credit: NASA.</em></figcaption></span><br>
									   Looking at the vertically integrated optical depth for a 'warm gas giant' Drift-Phoenix profile, we see that micro-porosity affects the silicate features at ~10 μm. As well as this, 
									   micro-porosity makes clouds optically thick for wavelengths up to 100 μm, compared to 20 μm for the compact case. Irregularly shape effects (through a DHS)
									   also increases the optically thick wavelength for both cases. Such affects are in the wavelength regime of MIRI and thus may be observable with JWST.</p>

									<p>Further details on the albedo of such cloud particles, as well as micro-porous one dimensional cloud structures for a range of planetary parameters, 
										and a Gaussian cloud particle size distribution are explored in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202037553">Paper</a>.</p>
										
										
									<h3 class="major">Global Cloud Effects on the Ultra-hot Jupiter HATP-7 b</h3>
									
									<p>As part of a collaboration among attendees at <a href="http://eos-nexus.org/clouds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Academy I</a>,
									   we modelled the global distribution of clouds on the Ultra-hot Jupiter
									   <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hat-p-7_b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAT-P-7b</a>. 
									   We used 97 one dimensional (p, T, Vz)-profiles extracted from a three dimensional, cloud-free, global circulation model.</p>

									<p>These profiles were used as input into a kinetic cloud formation model. We find cloud formation on the night-side,
										but a near absence of cloud formation on the day-side, which can be up to 2500 K hotter.</p>

									</div>
									<p><br></p>

									<p>Equatorial super-rotation causes the evening terminator (ɸ = 90.0°) to be warmer than the morning terminator (ɸ = 270.0°), 
										this produces different chemistry on the two terminators. It also causes an asymmetry in clouds, which affects the 
										optically observable depth of the atmosphere.</p>

										Thus one dimensional transmission spectra retrievals of atmospheric parameters will be biased by ignoring this effect.
